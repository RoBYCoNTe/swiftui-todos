# SwiftUI - ToDos
A fully (I'm not sure) featured project, written using SwiftUI (with the latest specs) that can teach you to:
- create simple lists
- work with navigation
- work with data manipulation

My bible: https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/tutorials

The project was built as output of my last two days of intese studing <3
