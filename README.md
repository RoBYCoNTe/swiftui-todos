# SwiftUI - ToDos
My first SwiftUI project.

# Up To Date!

After many years away from mobile development, in the last few days 
I'm involved in a new project, smartphone FIRST.

I spend my last two days reading the official apple doc about the new
Swift specs and few hours following great video tutorial (always on the apple web site).

My goals, since the last day, was to handle an entirely new project by myself, and that's it!
Now I'm going to commit my project, is just an example that helped my training what I've 
learnd, I hope to edit it and add more features based on my future goals.

Please, feel free to give me suggestion or highlight my mistakes!
